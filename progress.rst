This is a web-based conference management system.

It is written in Python and uses the web framework Pyramid.

Source code is managed using Git.

Additionally Australian Linux Conference 2013 in Canberra will be
using this project.


Started contacting and logging conferences:
Hi there!

I'm a student at ANU in Australia currently doing a course under the tutelage of Andrew Tridgell on Open Source Software development (http://cs.anu.edu.au/student/comp8440/).

I have an interest in conference management software from a FOSS point of view and was wondering:
what conference website software are you using for xxx

I would be delighted if you would be able to let me know.

Warmest regards,
Elena Williams
