<p>Part 1: Research for Project<br>
  ----------------------------</p>
<p>Preamble<br>
  ~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>There was never any question that my project would be on:<br>
  Conference Management software.</p>
<p>This is convenient for me:<br>
  ~ I have worked on technical conferences before<br>
  ~ I have worked with conference management software before<br>
  ~ I have worked with conference websites before</p>
<p>These experiences left me with an &quot;itch&quot;. I had thought about<br>
  conference software and had the good fortune of consulting with many<br>
  esteemed academics regarding their experiences and preferences and had<br>
  been left feeling unsatisfied with how extensively I'd been able to<br>
  use this knowledge.</p>
<p>In recent year I have worked as a python web developer.<br>

<p>Initial Homework<br>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Firstly the most obvious project to select nearly certainly going to be working
  on Zookeepr.</p>
<p>Choosing your project<br>
  Researching the project<br>
  Learning to build and install the project<br>
  Learning how to interact with the project developers<br>
  Finding some way that you can contribute<br>
  Working on your contribution<br>
  Communicating with other project developers<br>

<p>Zookeepr<br>
  ~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Who does the development?<br>
  How is it organised?<br>
  How is it licensed?<br>
  How is the source code managed?<br>
  How are stable releases done?<br>
  What communication methods are used?<br>
  How are bugs tracked?<br>
  How does it interact with other projects?</p>
<p>Is there a project team?<br>
  Is it part of a larger project?<br>
  Does it have any corporate involvement?<br>
  Is there any formal legal framework?<br>
  Who makes decisions?</p>
<p>'Cathedral' or 'Bazaar'?<br>
  Priests in a tower or a milling bazaar?</p>
<p>What patch format is wanted?<br>
  Against what version of the code?<br>
  How much explanation is wanted?<br>
  Are tests and documentation expected?<br>
  Is there a developer guide?<br>
  What happened with other patches?<br>
