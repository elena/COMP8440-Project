Day 1

Part 1: Research for Project
----------------------------

Preamble
~~~~~~~~

There was never any question that my project would be on:
Conference Management software.

This is convenient for me:
 ~ I have worked on technical conferences before
 ~ I have worked with conference management software before
 ~ I have worked with conference websites before

These experiences left me with an "itch". I had thought about
conference software and had the good fortune of consulting with many
esteemed academics regarding their experiences and preferences and had
been left feeling unsatisfied with how extensively I'd been able to
use this knowledge.

In recent year I have worked as a python web developer.


Initial Homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Firstly the most obvious project to select nearly certainly going to be working on Zookeepr.








Zookeepr
~~~~~~~~

Who does the development?
How is it organised?
How is it licensed?
How is the source code managed?
How are stable releases done?
What communication methods are used?
How are bugs tracked?
How does it interact with other projects?

Is there a project team?
Is it part of a larger project?
Does it have any corporate involvement?
Is there any formal legal framework?
Who makes decisions?
'Cathedral' or 'Bazaar'?
 
Priests in a tower or a milling bazaar?

What patch format is wanted?
Against what version of the code?
How much explanation is wanted?
Are tests and documentation expected?
Is there a developer guide?
What happened with other patches?
