<font size="-1">Hi Elena,<br>
<br>
As you may or may not be aware, the Linux Conference of Australia<br>
(<a href="http://linux.conf.au/" target="_top">linux.conf.au</a> or LCA) is to be held at ANU in January 2013 (next year).<br>
<br>
LCA uses a web-based registration and overall organisation system<br>
called zookeepr, which is written in Python. Each year the organising<br>
committee (which changes each year as the conference location changes)<br>
makes some changes to zookeepr to better reflect the way they want to<br>
organise the conference.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the LCA2013 conference organisers are organising a hackfest<br>
on zookeepr sometime in April. Are you/the Python user group at all<br>
interested in helping out with the hacking of zookeepr?<br>
<br>
I'll let Mikal (Michael) communicate more directly with you about what<br>
it is they are hoping to achieve with the hacking of zookeepr, if you<br>
are interested in getting involved.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
Bob Edwards.<br>

Hi Michael/Bob,<br>
<br>
I'd be interested in being involved in development zookeepr, apparently<br>
there was discussion about this at the CLUG meeting last week. I was really<br>
interested in coming down for this but didn't make it but am still<br>
interested in what came out of the discussion.<br>

Hi Elena,<br>
<br>
Actually, the CLUG/PSIG meeting last week never got onto zookeepr after<br>
all. The guy who was going to discuss it was a no show. He may have<br>
been thinking that he was to talk about it at the main CLUG meeting<br>
next week.<br>
<br>
I have heard him speak on zookeepr previously (he was involved in the<br>
LCA2010 LCA organisation for Brisbane). He wasn't all that clued up<br>
and, from what I have heard, there are varying accounts as to the<br>
usefulness of his contributions.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I think that there may still be a hackfest on zookeepr coming<br>
up, so I hope that Michael or whoever is organising it will keep<br>
yourself and/or the Python user group in the loop on that.<br>
<br>
I think that zookeepr may well be a good project for you to work on<br>
for your FOSSD project. There is certainly work to be done on it, so<br>
lots to write about etc.<br>
<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>

I'll be around the uni today for the "Women in Tech" stuff happening around<br>
lunchtime and it'd be great to meet.<br>
