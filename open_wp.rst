What I'm looking at is very specific:
technical conferences

Notable features
- abstracts
- schedules
- programs


*Lots* of projects which are "Events", seemingly aimed at events registrations.
My itch is only remotely related to registrations (frankly EventBrite can't be beat for

providing this service), but to do with something different.

I'm *NOT* particularly interested in the traditional "Events Management", such as:
Online Event Registration
Online and Email Marketing
Online Event Surveys
Event Planning
Payment Processing
Event Reporting
